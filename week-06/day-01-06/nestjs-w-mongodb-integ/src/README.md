# NestJS Project with MongoDB Integration

This is a NestJS application that connects to a MongoDB database and includes a `BooksModule` for managing book-related operations.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following required configuration:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
```

- **PORT**: The port your NestJS application will listen on.
- **MONGODB_URI**: The connection string for your MongoDB database.

### 4. Run the Application

Once you've set up your environment variables, start the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the application on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `3000`).

### 5. Testing the Application

Once the application is running, you can visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified) in your browser to check if the server is running.

### 6. Accessing API Endpoints

If the `BooksModule` has CRUD endpoints implemented, you can access them via the appropriate routes (depending on how the module is structured).

For example:

- `GET /books`: Retrieve all books.
- `POST /books`: Add a new book.
- `PUT /books/:id`: Update a book by ID.
- `DELETE /books/:id`: Delete a book by ID.

> **Note**: Customize the routes and API details based on the actual implementation of the `BooksModule`.

## Folder Structure

```bash

  ├── main.ts             # Application bootstrap file
  ├── books/              # Books module containing controllers, services, and models
  ├── .env               # Environment variables file
  └── ...
```
